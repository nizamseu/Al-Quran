When man looks at the world around him, he cannot fail to notice God’s power and mercy abundantly in evidence everywhere. Wherever he casts his glance, he finds extraordinary order and supervision. Everything has been extraordinarily and astonishingly adapted to man’s needs. This observation shows that the great cosmic machine cannot be in vain. Therefore, one realizes that there must come a day when the grateful and the ungrateful are rewarded for the way they have lived their lives in this world. One spontaneously entreats God in words to this effect, ‘Lord, You are the Master of the Day of Judgement. I have submitted to You and humbly seek Your help; have mercy on me. Lord, show us the path that is, to You, the true path. Enable us to tread the path of Your chosen servants. Help us to avoid the path of those who have gone astray, and the path of those who have incurred Your wrath due to their obstinacy.’ God requires His servant to live his life with such feelings and emotions.

Similarly, Jesus says in the Bible, ‘I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.’ (Matthew, 10:34). But these statements were made in quite specific circumstances. The Quran emphasizes that permission to fight is given only to those under attack (22:39). Clearly, only defensive war is permissible. Guerilla warfare, aggressive attacks, undeclared war, including terrorism and suicide bombings, are all strictly unlawful in Islam and negate the true teachings of the Quran and the Hadith, which are based on peace and non-violence.

Kindly remove the bad effects of any improper food I have put in my mouth; the evil words I have uttered, and the evil things I have seen.’ Thereafter, when he takes water in hands and massages his head with his hands, his whole existence is moulded by the prayers, ‘O, God! Wash away the bad effects of the evil ideas conceived by my mind and wrong plans devised by me, and cleanse and purify my mind.’ When he washes his feet, this action of his becomes the entreaty before his Lord, that He may cleanse his feet of the dust of evil and make them (his feet) never tread any path except the path of righteousness and justice.

It adopts the same ways as are rooted in its instinct in all its dealings. The same is true of the human being as regards his ‘God-consciousness’. In the soul of a human being the consciousness of a Creator and Lord has been instilled so deep-rootedly that he never loses it. However, there is one difference between animals and human beings. Animals are not capable of going against their nature. They are compelled to do whatever their inner nature urges them to do. But the case of a human being is different. This awareness is embedded in his nature, but he is completely free in the matter of action, even although his mind and his conscience start pointing out to him what is right and what is wrong. A human being has therefore the power and the option either to follow his inner voice, or to ignore it and start doing whatever he likes. It is on such occasions of moral choice that man is on trial and on the basis of its result, decisions regarding heaven or hell are taken. The person who lends his ears to the voice of God and does whatever He tells him to do through the silent language of ‘Nature’, passes the test. The doors of heaven (Paradise) will be thrown open for him after death, whereas one who ignores the voice of God speaking at Nature’s level, will be held guilty in the eyes of God and He will ignore him as he ignored God’s voice."}},"7:175":{"t":"Recite to them the tale of the man to whom We gave Our signs, but who then cast them to one side and Satan overtook him.

She constantly tried to seduce him and one day, finding the opportunity, she closed the door of the room. This was a very critical occasion for an unmarried youth, but Joseph had preserved his godly nature and this nature came to his rescue on this occasion. The capacity to distinguish between truth and untruth, right and wrong, is ingrained in every human being by birth and this serves as a warning on all such occasions. To ignore it amounts to ignoring the voice of God. One who does so is deprived of God’s succour so that his moral strength gradually ebbs away. On the contrary, one who immediately bows down before the divine call, as soon as it is given, can count on God’s help; this improves his moral fibre and on future occasions he becomes stronger in the face of evil. What prevented Joseph from indulging in evil was in fact the fear of God but, at that time, invoking God before Zulaykha would have been ineffective. This was not an occasion for a declaration of Truth but an occasion when he had to save himself in a critical situation. In view of this situation he referred to Zulaykha’s  husband.

At this stage, in fact, this is a statement of repudiation and not the utterance of a missionary call."}},"109:2":{"t":"I do not worship what you worship.","f":{}},"109:3":{"t":"You do not worship what I worship.","f":{}},"109:4":{"t":"I will never worship what you worship.","f":{}},"109:5":{"t":"You will never worship what I worship.","f":{}},"109:6":{"t":"You have your religion and I have mine.’<sup foot_note=\"213010\">1</sup>","f":{"213010":"‘You have your religion and I have mine’—this is an expression of mutual understanding meaning, ‘follow one and respect all’.

Causing people to join the fold of Islam in great numbers in itself is the greatest help to God, and it is in this way that religious people will reach the destination of victory and domination. Accordingly, during the last days of the Prophet the position was that a larger number of people entered the Islamic fold, thus opening the door to further conquests. For a believer, victory increases his feeling of humility. Even for his apparently right action, he seeks God’s pardon. Even the success he achieves, seemingly by his own efforts, he attributes to the will of God."}},"111:1":{"t":"May the hands of Abu Lahab perish, may he be ruined.","f":{}},"111:2":{"t":"Neither his wealth nor his gains will avail him.","f":{}},"111:3":{"t":"He shall soon enter a Blazing Fire,","f":{}},"111:4":{"t":"and also his wife who carries the fuel,","f":{}},"111:5":{"t":"with a rope of twisted fibre round her neck.<sup foot_note=\"213012\">1</sup>","f":{"213012":"Abu Lahab, the name of an actual person, has come to denote a particular kind of character. ‘Abu Lahab’ has come to be a symbol of such an opponent of the call for the acceptance of Truth as will stoop in his hostility to meanness. Just as the Prophet had to face this character, similarly other missionaries among his followers (ummah) may have to face just such a character. However, if the missionary has become active for the sake of God in the real sense, then God’s help will be given to him. The inimical efforts of people like Abu Lahab will, by God’s grace, become ineffective and, in spite of all their means and resources, they will perish. They will themselves burn in the fire of their own jealousy and enmity. Their aim may have been wanting to drag the missionary of God to a miserable end, but they themselves will be the ones to suffer that everlasting fate."}},"112:1":{"t":"Say, ‘He is God, the One,","f":{}},"112:2":{"t":"God, the Self-sufficient One.","f":{}},"112:3":{"t":"He does not give birth, nor was He born,","f":{}},"112:4":{"t":"and there is nothing like Him.’<sup foot_note=\"213013\">1</sup>","f":{"213013":"This chapter of the Quran is about the oneness of God.

It is this God who can remove the dark clouds of trouble overshadowing a man and bring him into the sunshine of well-being. The present world has been made with a view to putting human beings to the test. So, here there is evil along with good. The only way for man to be safe from the ill effects of evil is to seek refuge in God against it. Evil is of different kinds. For example, the mischief indulged in by evil-hearted people in the dead of the night, and the practitioners of witchcraft. Similarly, there are individuals who, seeing others living prosperously, become jealous and make the latter the victims of their jealousy-inspired actions. A believer should seek refuge in God from the mischief of all such people, and undoubtedly it is God alone who has the power to protect man from all kinds of evil."}},"114:1":{"t":"Say, ‘I seek refuge in the Lord of people,","f":{}},"114:2":{"t":"the King of people,","f":{}},"114:3":{"t":"the God of people,","f":{}},"114:4":{"t":"from the mischief of every sneaking whisperer,","f":{}},"114:5":{"t":"who whispers into the hearts of people,","f":{}},"114:6":{"t":"from jinn and men.’<sup foot_note=\"213015\">1</sup>","f":{"213015":"Man is a humble creature. He essentially needs protection. But this cannot be given to him by anybody except the one and only God. It is God who is the Lord and Sustainer of all human beings. It is He who is their King. It is He alone who is worth worshipping. Indeed, who except God can become the support of believers in their trials and tribulations? The most dangerous mischief against which man should seek God’s refuge is that of Satan. He is most dangerous because he always hides his real position. He misleads people by his deceitful ways. So, only one who is extremely alert can save himself from the machinations of Satan. He is one to whom God has given the capacity to distinguish between Truth and Untruth; who can understand what is reality and what is falsity. Evil-inspirers are not only the known Satans. Even among human beings there are certain Satan-like people who present themselves in artificial guises and, by means of deceitful words, brain-wash others and put them on the path of misguidance. Seeking refuge in God from mischief is a two-sided action. On the one hand, it entails obtaining God’s grace. On the other hand, its purpose is to awaken one’s awareness of mischief so that one may become capable of countering it more consciously."}}}
